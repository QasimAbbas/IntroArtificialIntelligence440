### Proposional Logic in Wumpus Worlds

* Propositional Logic provides tools for representing problems but 
 * time is not easily expressed
 * you do not have operators
    like ∀, ∃
    
    * you have to go to higher-order logic
    
* Another way to represent problems is thorugh 
  * Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL)
    * States are represented as conjuntions of positive literals
      * (everything that is not mentioned is assumed to be fine)
    * Actions are specified by giving their Preconditions and their Effects

* When is an action applicable?
  * When all preconditions are satisfied in th ecurrent state
  
* Execturing an action 'a' at state 's'
  * results in a new state s' which is similar to s where fluents that appear negative in the Effects(a) are removed and the positive ones are added 
  

* Time is represente implicitly, precondition refers to time t and effects refer to time t+1

* Variables are treated as existential quantifiers: At (p,SFO) ∩ Place(p) ∃ α plane in SFO

```
Action: Move(x,)
```

* Given a PDDL problem specification, we can follow 2 high-level search procedures:
    * forward search
        * Set as a root of the search tree the initial state
        * Define actions that are applicable to generate children
    * backward search
        * starts from the goal state and considers actions whose effects agree with the state specification.  Typically the # of action in this case is smaller than forward
