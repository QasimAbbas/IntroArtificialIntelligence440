### Proposional Logic in Wumpus Worlds

* Propositional Logic provides tools for representing problems but 
 * time is not easily expressed
 * you do not have operators
    like ∀, ∃
    
    * you have to go to higher-order logic
    
* Another way to represent problems is thorugh 
  * Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL)
    * States are represented as conjuntions of positive literals
      * (everything that is not mentioned is assumed to be fine)
    * Actions are specified by giving their Preconditions and their Effects

* When is an action applicable?
  * When all preconditions are satisfied in th ecurrent state
  
* Execturing an action 'a' at state 's'
  * results in a new state s' which is similar to s where fluents that appear negative in the Effects(a) are removed and the positive ones are added
